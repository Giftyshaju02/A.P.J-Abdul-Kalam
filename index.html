                  <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute 
                    of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium
                    after a brief rest.At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.He was rushed to the 
                    nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being 
                    placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.His last words
                    to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"<br>
                    Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was
                    flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with
                    the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg.<br></p>

                    his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. 
                    that evening.<br>
